                The depletion of many vital non-renewable sources of
                energy, especially fossil fuel, has been a topic of 
                discussion for many of those with interest or knowledge
                in the field of energy.
                <br><br> 
                Europe is a continent where many countries are leading the
                way in using renewable resources more and more to slowly 
                replace the depleting resources.
                <br><br>
                This visualization aims to reveal Europe's progress in 
                replacing the depleting non-renewable sources of energy
                with renewable ones.

                <h2>The Energy Powerhouse <br> of Europe</h2>
                <p>
                    This first visualization illustrates the total amount 
                    of "Generation" (Power Generation) from each European country for each
                    year from 2000 to 2020.
                    <br><br> 
                    It is safe to say that Germany is the largest producer
                    of power in Europe throughout 21 years from 2000 to
                    2020. In contrast, Luxembourg is the smallest producer.
                    <br><br>
                    The contribution of various energy sources in generating power 
                    from each country can be observed through this visualization 
                    as well.

                <h2>Share of Production &<br>Change from Last Year</h2>
                <p>
                    This Scattered Plot Chart shows the relationship between Share of Production
                    (%) and Generation(TWh) for each country, additionally categorized by
                    Energy Source. It also depicts the changes compared to last year(%).
                    <br><br>
                    One of many that can be observed is that French is the country that generates
                    the most power through Nuclear. Another one would be that Germany produces
                    the most power through Fossil fuels.

                <h2>The Energy Source <br> Europe Is Most Reliant ON</h2>
                <p>
                    This visualization exhibits the total generation of power
                    from each energy source, throughout all of Europe from
                    2000 to 2020.
                    <br><br>
                    It can be concluded, unsurprisingly, that Fossil fuel is 
                    the source Europe generates their power from. It is closely
                    followed by Nuclear and Coal.

                <h2>Renewable vs Non-Renewable Energy Sources</h2>
                <p>
                    The 2 map visualizations above highlight total share of 
                    production of energy from renewable sources, and from 
                    non-renewable sources respectively.
                    <br><br>
                    It can be established that every country used both 
                    sources in varying ratios throughout the years from
                    2000 to 2020. However, it can be seen that in ther 
                    latter years, the reliance renewable sources has seen
                    a slow yet steady increase and vice versa, the reliance
                    on non-renewable sources is on a very slight decline.

                <h5>What Can Be Established?</h5>
                <p>
                    These visualizations seem to share a mutual finding,
                    and that is the trend where reliance on renewable 
                    resources is seeing an increase, albeit slow.
                    <br><br>
                    As a result, the reliance on non-renewable resources
                    is also seeing a slight downward trend.
                    <br><br>
                    This is very good news, especially when many of These
                    non-renewable resources have had people predicting 
                    the day they are depleted. These renewable resources
                    are proving to be an excellent alternative.
